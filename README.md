<h3>Question #7</h3>
The organization works with private addressing and netmask /24. How many computers in the organization are involved in the capture? <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/16t1a4O.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
<br />
We can observe all the IPv4 addresses participating in the network capture by navigating to Statistics > IPv4 Statistics > All Addresses. 
<br/> There are four addresses in the 10.4.10.x range. However, since one is 10.4.10.255, designated as a broadcast address unsuitable for assignment to any specific computer, we only  have three assignable addresses.  <br/>

<br />

With Brim, we can see the presence of DHCP traffic in this capture. 
<br/> Upon searching for DHCP packets in Wireshark, we can locate a DHCPINFORM packet. After inspecting the packet, we can ascertain that the client included the Host Name option, allowing us to extract the hostname of the computer.  <br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZYV2Iuv.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
<br />
We can go ahead and pull up packet 204 and locate the DNS Query field, where we can find the domain <br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6LLHBiS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
<br />
We can use IP Geolocation to get the location of the IP<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Question #13 </h3>
Q13: What operating system does the victimâ€™s computer run? <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6LLHBiS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
By examining the HTTP User-Agent of the computer, we can initiate the operating system on the system. <br/>
Among several HTTP logs in this capture, only the one originating from the browser at proforma-invoices.com appears relevant. <br/>
Consequently, we can determine the operating system running on the machine based on the information in the mentioned header. It appears that our target is using Windows NT 6.1.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Question #14 </h3>
What is the name of the malicious file downloaded by the accountant? <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CkZbkwU.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
<br />
We will need to extract the information needed, Hence, File > Export Objects > HTTP to get the objects. <br/>

<h3>Question #15 </h3>
What is the md5 hash of the downloaded file? <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gd1ViW3.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
<br />
Once we extract the Http above, we can use Virus total to get the MD5 Hash <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Question #16 </h3>
What software runs the webserver that hosts the malware?? <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XB6E11k.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
Choosing the malicious file from the HTTP object list will simultaneously highlight the packet indicating the commencement of the HTTP stream. <br/>
Utilizing the Follow > HTTP Stream option allows us to capture the entire stream. <br/>
Analyzing the followed HTTP headers data enables us to identify the web server operating on the server. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<h3>Question #17 </h3>
What is the md5 hash of the downloaded file? <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gd1ViW3.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Question 3"/>
<br />
Examining the HTTP object list reveals communication with another site named bot[.]whatismyipaddress[.]com, a recognized service for obtaining a computer's Public IP Address. <br/>
Choosing the HTTP object record will also highlight the packet signifying the initiation of the HTTP stream. By utilizing Follow > HTTP Stream, <br/> 
we can capture the complete stream. Analyzing the following HTTP headers data lets us retrieve the public IP address. <br/>
